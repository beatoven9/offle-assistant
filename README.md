### Description

---

Offle-assistant is a framework for building LLM Agents without any coding whatsoever.

This code-base contains the CLI version of the program and the REST API for communication with the offle-assistant front-end which is an under-development React web app. Once the web-app is complete. A single sys-admin can set up offle-assistant on a cluster or cloud service provider to give access to a full team of non-coders. The team will be able to build, share, and deploy LLM Agents to complete tasks. Building an LLM Agent is as easy as supplying a system prompt, selecting a model, upload documents for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tune the RAG prompt for your specific use case. LLM Agents can be as fine grained as being user-documentation experts or as general as being a customer support assistant.
