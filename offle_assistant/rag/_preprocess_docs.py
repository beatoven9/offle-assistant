        If I want to parallelize this, I need to be sure I don't accidentally
        write to the same file twice. Hypothetically, you could have two
        files with the same name but different formats in the src/ dir
        (eg: file_a.pdf and file_a.epub). They would then both be written to
        file_a.md, potentially at the exact same time. Not good.
        Probably, I collect output file names first because that should be
        quick, and then I can perform that check in the loop. If all goes
        well, then we can parallelize safely.
